			<h1><a name="InstallationPlanning"></a>Installation Planning</h1>
		<p>The following section details installation requirements for the product software and includes planning exercises for installing components in a target environment.</p>
		<h2><a name="HardwareRequirements"></a>Hardware Requirements</h2>
		<p>The following section explains both the minimum and recommended hardware requirements.</p>
		<h3><a name="Minimum Hardware Requirements"></a>Minimum Hardware Requirements</h3>
		<p>The following  specifications outline the <em>minimum</em> requirements for running the Velocity Studio software only:</p>
		<ul>
          <li>2.4 GHz Pentium processor or faster </li>
          <li>1 GB <em>available </em>RAM (for Windows 32-bit)</li>
          <li> 4 GB <em>available </em>RAM             (for Windows 64-bit) <br>
          </li>
          <li>4 GB disk space</li>
          </ul>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong>
		<ul>
		  <li>These specifications  are only for running the product software. They do not take into account the  additional hardware requirements needed for the operating  system and the Java Virtual Machine<sup>TM</sup> (JVM), which are required for running the product.</li>
		  <li>These specifications are only for the developer’s  personal environment. They do not reflect the hardware requirements for the shared  development, testing or production environments where addition resources will  be needed based on factors such as the number of orders, the number of  simultaneous users, database access requirements, and so on.</li>
		  <li>Available memory is  required for larger metadata.</li>
		  </ul>
       
        <h3><a name="Recommended Hardware Requirements"></a>Recommended Hardware Requirements</h3>
        <p>The following specifications outline the <em>recommended</em> requirements for running  Velocity Studio on a single machine:</p>
		<ul>
          <li>Intel Core<sup>TM</sup> i5, i7, or equivalent</li>
          <li>6 GB – 8 GB <em>available</em> system RAM </li>
          <li>60 GB free disk space for the metadata, database, and other application  resource files.</li>
         </ul>
        <p><strong>Note: </strong>These specification are only for the developer’s personal environment. They do not reflect the hardware requirements for the deployment or production environment where addition resources will be needed based on factors such as the number of orders, the number of simultaneous users, database access requirements, and so on.</p>
        
         
        <h2>Software Requirements</h2>
		<p>The following are software prerequisites:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Database</li>
			<li>JDK</li>
			<li>Browser</li>
			<li>Revision Control System (optional)</li>
			<li>Application Server (optional)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In an isolated development environment, the database typically resides on the same machine as the product. However, the database can reside on a separate machine, provided that database privileges are granted to apply SQL scripts automatically generated by the product during installation and application development.</p>

		<h2>General Notes</h2>
		<p>The aforementioned physical memory and disk space requirements are based on product requirements only.</p>
		<p>The installation screenshots are taken from a Windows installation. 
		 For the UNIX installation, you have to change the paths to the corresponding 
		 Unix paths. Additionally, screens where user input is required 
		 may have different options depending on operating system. These 
		 screens are noted.</p>
		<p>The  deployment commands can be executed simultaneously. As such, it is possible to perform simultaneous deployment of the product (in different database schemas, but on the same machine).</p>
		<h2>Tool and Platform Eligibility</h2>
		<p>The product installation consists of the following components:</p>
		 
		<table class="confluenceTable" border cellpadding="1">
			<tr>
				<th class="confluenceTh">Component</th>

		<p>Application development is expected to be in Windows environment. As a result, Velocity Studio is certified on <b>Windows</b> platform only. For packaging and deployment environments, both <b>UNIX</b> and <b>Windows</b> platforms are expected. As such, a UNIX installation of Velocity Studio is expected to be limited to the use of command-line interface of <i>Designer.jar</i>, such as to run, package, and validate metadata.</p>

		<h2><a name="CertificationMatrix"></a>Supported Configurations</h2>
		<p>The following table specifies development  environment (that is, Velocity Studio) and deployment environment  configurations, and common requirements to both environments. For a deployment  environment, each configuration is certified as a combination of application  server, operating system, and Java™ Development Kit (JDK).<br>
		</p>
		<p><img src="CertificationMatrix.png" alt="Certification matrix" border="0" /></p>
		<ul>
          <li><i>* JRockit disabled; Sun JDK is used.</i></li>
         <!-- <li><i>All environments use 32-bit version of the OS and the JDK except for the following:
          	  <ul>
          	<li>Oracle WebLogic with Linux Red Hat 5 is certified on both 32- and 64-bit versions</li>
          	<li>HP-UX 11.31 with WebSphere is only certified on 64-bit versions</li>
          	<li>SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 Service Pack 1 is certified on 64-bit versions</li>
       	    </ul>
          </i></li> -->
          <li><i>(+) Plus sign indicates that this and all higher versions at the fourth digit of the JDK extensions are certified. (for example, 1.7.0_51+ means that 1.7.0.51 and any higher 1.7.0.xx versions are certified.)</i></li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Notes:</strong> 
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The release notes contain the latest certification matrix by clicking the Certification Matrix tab. Contact Support if you require the latest set of release notes.</li>
            <li>When using Windows 7, 64-bit version, the Velocity Studio requires that the JDK be 64-bit.</li>
            <li>Minor versions deviations are acceptable (for example, JBoss EAP 6.1.1) and are considered certified.</li>
          </ul>
          For support on other platforms, contact the Support team.</blockquote>
<h3>Known Limitations</h3>
	<ul>
        <li>Due to limitations in the Mozilla platform, the 
		 Firefox browser is subject to minor text-wrapping mishandling 
		 when dealing with large fields that contain no spaces.</li>
		<li>For Firefox (all versions) <!--and Internet Explorer 8,--> only one user session can be 
		 created per machine. If multiple browser sessions are created 
		 to connect to the same framework, they share the same 
		 user session (for example, login once, and the second browser session 
		 is automatically logged in). It is not recommended for these browsers to have more than one open at a time. <!--For Internet Explorer 6 and 7, 
		 it is possible to have multiple separated browser instances, by 
		 creating a new Internet Explorer instance via clicking the Internet 
		 Explorer shortcut icon; new tabs or new windows of the same Internet 
		 Explorer instance do not separate the user sessions.--></li>
	</ul>
			 
		<h2>Licensing</h2>
		<p>All software components are authorized to run by valid license files (for example, license.lic). If you do not have a license file 
		 or if your existing license has expired, all software components will cease to run. In the event your license has expired or if you have not received a license, contact your sales representative.<br style="clear: all;" clear="all" />
