<p>The following step is optional and may be completed if you want to verify that your installation is correct.</p>

<h3><a name="LogintotheAdministrationApplication"></a>Log into the Administration Application</h3>

To log into the Administration application, complete these steps:<ol>
<li>From Velocity Studio, select <b>Runtime</b> &gt; <b>Run</b>.
<p><b>Note:</b> If you have just completed configuration with the Configuration application, a system restart is necessary to reload the configuration data. Stop the run before restarting the system (select <b>Runtime</b> &gt; <b>Stop)</b>. </li>
</li><li>Log into the Administration application:</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>Open a Web browser and load enter <a href="http://localhost:8080/cwf/login">http://localhost:8080/cwf/</a> as the URL.</li>
<li>Enter <b>upadmin</b> as both the <b>Username</b> and the <b>Password</b>, and click the <b>OK</b> button to enter the System Administration application.</li></ol></ol>
<p>In a Windows environment, the standard output and error for the Velocity Studio are redirected to <em>&lt;<em>installation_folder</em>&gt;\designer\env\log</em>. The log filename is appended with the date and time that the application was started (for example, <em>logFile.2009-09-15.log</em>). You can troubleshoot problems with these log files when using Velocity Studio.</p>
<p>You can also determine what software version you are using and its exact build number by locating your <em>&lt;<em>installation_folder</em>&gt;\readme.txt</em>. The build format contains the software version (for example, 14.0.0.0) followed by the build number (for example, b1001 denotes build number 1001). This information is important should you require technical assistance to troubleshoot problems with the <a href="../support/supportIntro.html">Support team</a>.</p>
<p>You may perform directory clean-up regularly, as new log files will be created whenever the Velocity Studio is launched on a new day.</p>
