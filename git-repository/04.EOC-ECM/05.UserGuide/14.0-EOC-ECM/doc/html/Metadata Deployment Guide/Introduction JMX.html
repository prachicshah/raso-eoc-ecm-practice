<h1>Introduction to JMX</h1>
<p><strong>Java&#8482; Management Extensions</strong> (JMX) is a Java technology that supplies tools for managing and monitoring applications, system objects, devices, and more. Those resources are represented by objects called MBeans (Managed Beans), are objects that represent these resources. In the API, classes can be dynamically loaded and instantiated. </p>
<p>This section contains the following information:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong><a href="Profiling.html">Profiling with JConsole</a></strong><br>
    JConsole is a JMX-compliant monitoring tool, which is provided as part   of Sun's Java SDK. With JConsole, you can monitor JVMs extensively, such   as the runtime deployed in any J2EE container with <a href="J2EE Application Server Installation.html#JMX">JMX arguments enabled</a>. </p>
  <p><strong><a href="Shutting Down the PE.html">Shut down the PE</a></strong><br>
    Process engines can be gracefully shutdown by simply stopping their   service at their hosted J2EE application servers. As an alternative   approach, you can gracefully shut down a process engine through JConsole.  </p>
  <p><strong><a href="JConsole monitor and manage mbeans.html">Monitor and Manage MBeans in JConsole</a></strong><br>
    The MBeans tab allows you to view, monitor, and manage information on   all registered MBeans on your server. Specifically, this tab allows you   to view, change, and monitor the com.conceptwave.AVM class, which   reveals caching, queuing, and performance monitoring properties.
</p>
  <p>You can access the following domains using the left tree navigation in JConsole. Additionally, a reference for JConsole MBeans is available.</p>
