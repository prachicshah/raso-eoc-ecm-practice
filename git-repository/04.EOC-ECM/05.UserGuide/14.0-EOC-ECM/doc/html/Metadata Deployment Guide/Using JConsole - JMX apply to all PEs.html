<h2>Apply JMX Commands to all Running PEs</h2>
<p>To apply JMX commands to all running process engines (PEs) in a single request, the <strong>Apply to all PE</strong> attribute is available from JConsole by clicking <strong>com.conceptWave.AVM &gt; Verbose &gt; Attributes &gt; Apply to all PE</strong> in the left pane. </p>
<p><img src="Using JConsole - Apply to all PEs.png" alt="JConsole - Apply to all PE attribute"></p>
<p>By default, the <strong>Apply to all PE</strong> attribute is set to <strong>false</strong>, meaning that attribute changes apply to attributes on the current PE only and you work with Verbose attributes as you did before.</p>
<p>However, when the <strong>Apply to all PE</strong> attribute is set to <strong>true</strong>, the next command to change another attribute's value applies to this attribute on all running PEs. Once this attribute is updated on all running PEs, the <strong>Apply to all PE</strong> attribute is set to <strong>false</strong>, ensuring that you specify this flag each time it is required and does not accidentally change other attributes on all PEs.</p>
<p>The following are examples on how the <strong>Apply to all PE</strong> attribute value affects each PE's <strong>verbose mask</strong> value.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Two PEs, PE1 and PE2, are running.</li>
  <li>PE1 has the <strong>verbose mask</strong> attribute set to <strong>70</strong>. PE2 has <strong>verbose mask</strong> set to <strong>70</strong>.</li>
  <li>You are working with the connection to PE1 and the <strong>Apply to all PE</strong> attribute is set to <strong>false</strong>.</li>
  <li>You change the value of <strong>verbose mask</strong> to <strong>80</strong>.</li>
  <li>The results are that PE1 has <strong>verbose mask</strong> set to <strong>80</strong> and PE2 has <strong>verbose attribute</strong> set to <strong>70</strong>.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Apply to all PE</strong> attribute is set to <strong>false</strong>.</li>
  </ol>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Two PEs, PE1 and PE2, are running.</li>
  <li>PE1 has the <strong>verbose mask</strong> attribute set to <strong>80</strong>. PE2 has <strong>verbose mask</strong> set to <strong>70</strong>.</li>
  <li>You are working with the connection to PE1 and the <strong>Apply to all PE</strong> attribute is set to <strong>true</strong>.</li>
  <li>You change the value of <strong>verbose mask</strong> to <strong>50</strong>.</li>
  <li>The results are that PE1 has <strong>verbose mask</strong> set to <strong>50</strong> and PE2 has the same attribute set to <strong>50</strong>.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Apply to all PE</strong> attribute is set to <strong>false</strong>.<br>
  </li>
  </ol>
