<h2>Process Activities</h2>
<p>A Process is a progressively continuing flow of executable activities, directed toward a particular goal. An Activity is a component that performs a specific function within a process. Activities can be as simple as sending or receiving a message, or as complex as coordinating the execution of other processes and activities.</p>
<p>Activities are either <em>atomic</em> or <em>complex</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <em>atomic</em> activity is an elementary unit of work that cannot be further decomposed. <em>Atomic</em> activities can be used to start other processes, perform calculations, or perform operations.</li>
<li>A <em>complex</em> activity is composed of other activities, and directs the execution of these activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>All activities of a specific process instance are executed by the same Process Engine.</p>
