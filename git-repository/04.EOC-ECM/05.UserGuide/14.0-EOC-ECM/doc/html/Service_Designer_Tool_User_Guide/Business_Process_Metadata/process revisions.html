<h2>Process Revisions</h2>

<p>A <b>Process Revision</b> is an archive of User Process metadata object, a "snapshot" taken of the Process metadata object, after which the Process metadata may be changed (that is, changes made to Process Activities in Process). As a Process metadata object is changed over application development cycles, the "latest" process metadata may contain many Process Revisions.</p>
<p>Process Revisions are  the same type as Process metadata. Each Process Revision is a read-only Process.</p>
<p>In Velocity Studio, Process Revisions can be found under their <b>Process</b> node in the <strong>Metadata</strong> tab of the <b>Navigation</b> pane,  after you click the <b>Show Revisions</b> command in the right-click menu of the Process node. Process Revisions are read-only metadata objects.</p>

<p>With Process Revisions, every runtime process instance can be executed to completion with the Process metadata that it was instantiated with. This is the case, and the default behaviour if no <a href="process migration.html">migration</a> is defined, even if Process metadata is changed over the span of Process execution (which may take days or months). This feature is commonly referred to as <i>grand-parenting</i>.</p>

<p>Process Revisioning is only available for User Processes, but not to Global Processes. Existing Global Process instances are restarted by Process Engine startup with new Global Process metadata. Specifically, if revision number of Global Process instances in database differs from its metadata's revision number, they are removed at PE startup and then new Global Process instances are started with the current Process metadata.

when PE starts it checks whether global process metadata is in revision # different from the revision # of the process instance in database. If so, it deletes previous global process record from database. Next, PE thread finds that there is no record in the database for the given process and starts process with latest metadata.  In simple words, if global process database record revision # differs from metadata revision #, PE re-starts global process on the new metadata.</p>

<h3><a name="new">Creating Process Revisions</a></h3>
<p>Process Revisions are generated by the user, manually and  individually for each process. The user is in full control of what revisions are needed and when to generate them.</p>
<p>Before working on a process, the user   must first generate a new revision  to solidify the previous workflow in a revision  object. The user “acquires” the process in a new revision for his modifications  and should continue working on the process in the same revision number until all  changes are done. The user can deploy and run the process as many times as needed. However, it is recommended that the user stays with the same revision number until all the desired changes  are done. This way, all modifications can stay within the context of a single  revision without leaving multiple non-used revision objects behind.</p>
<p>To create a Process Revision, right-click the Process and select <strong>New Revision</strong>.</p>

<h3><a name="removeRev">Removing Process Revisions</a></h3>

<p>Over time, many old Process Revisions may accumulate under a Process. These old Process Revisions can be safely <a href="process operations.html#deleteRev">removed </a> from your application metadata as long as there are no more process instances that require them. You should look into your process instances and their corresponding <a href="process status.html">process status</a> in the target environment. From a runtime perspective, a Process Revision is no longer necessary to Process Engine if Process metadata has defined <a href="migration.html">migration record</a> on that revision, even though you may want to continue archiving it for informational purpose. In general, it is recommended that you to keep those Process Revisions that still bear business process significance to your organization.</p>

<h3><a name="runtime">Process Revisioning in Runtime</a></h3>

<p>In deployment environment, the all Process metadata objects are guaranteed to have the same definition as its latest Process Revision, thanks to <a href="Metadata Build WAR.html">packaging</a>.</p>

<p>For new process instances, they are labeled with the latest Process Revision number upon instantiation and executed according to that revision.</p>

<p>For existing process instances, <a href="migration.html">Process Migration</a> may occur when processes are started or resumed. The Process Instance's labeled Process Revision number is compared with the <b>Revision</b> property of the Process metadata:
<ul>
<li>If the two numbers are the same, their execution remains unchanged.</li>
<li>If the instance's number is less than its Process metadata Revision number, then</li>
	<ul>
	<li>the process instance executes at its Process Revision if no <a href="migration.html">migration record</a> for this revision number is defined in the Process metadata (that is, <i>grand-parenting</i>), or </li>
	<li>executes as per migration record if defined (may it be <i>suspend</i>, <i>terminate</i> or <i>migrate</i>).</li>
	<li>if neither migration record or its Process Revision is present, the process instances goes into <i>error</i> <a href="process status.html">status</a>.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore for existing process instances, the migration record in Process Revisions are not relevant to process migration; only migration record of the current Process metadata is executed.
<h3>Analyze Processes Tool</h3>
<p>The Analyze Processes tool allows you to compare and check the compatibility between  the local process metadata and the deployed process metadata. It  is highly recommended that you perform the comparison prior to deploying metadata,  especially in production, to ensure metadata compatibility and to avoid runtime  process exceptions. To read more about the tool, see <a href="../Service Designer Menu Actions/Runtime Analyze Processes.html">Analyze Processes</a>.</p>
