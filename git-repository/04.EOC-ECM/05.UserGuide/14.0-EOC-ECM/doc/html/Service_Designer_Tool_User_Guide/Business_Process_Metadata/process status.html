<h2>Process Status</h2>
<p>Every process instance maintains a process status that can have one of the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Executing (1)</em>: The process is running (executing).</li>
<li><em>Suspended (2)</em>: The process is suspended. Only user processes can be suspended. Processes can be suspended and restarted through the <a href="../../System_Administration_Application_User_Guide/Manage/memory processes.html">System Administration application</a>.</li>
<li><em>Completed (3)</em>: The process has completed executing successfully.</li>
<li><em>Aborted (4)</em>: The process is aborted. The process receives an aborted status when the Process Manager framework detects a failure in the Process Engine that executes this process. Aborted processes will return to executing status once restarted.</li>
<li><em>Error (5)</em>: The process is in error. The process receives an error status when an error occurs during process activity execution (such as a JavaScript error or a database error). The Process Engine will stop executing a process that receives an error status. Such processes can be restarted (after the problem is corrected) through the <a href="../../System_Administration_Application_User_Guide/Manage/memory processes.html">System Administration application</a>.</li>
<li><em>Terminated (6)</em>: The process is terminated. The process receives a terminated status when a terminate request is sent to the process from the <a href="../../System_Administration_Application_User_Guide/Manage/memory processes.html">System Administration application</a> or from migration record. The process will stop immediately. Terminated processes cannot be resumed.</li>
<li><em>Cancelled (7)</em>: The process starts a subprocess in   synchronous mode, with the subprocess activity having the <strong>synchronization</strong> checkbox selected. 
  The process waits in this activity for the child process to complete. If the child process throws an exception, but   does not have a handler to process this exception, it goes into Cancelled status   and does not run other activities. The exception is then sent to the parent process.</li>
</ul>
