<h2>User Participant</h2>
<p>The User Participant represents a person who performs manual tasks within a process. When a process flow reaches a manual task, the process sends a request to the user to perform this manual activity. The user notifies the process when he is finished the task. To allow interactions between process and user, the User Participant defines the interface such that the requests that a process sends to the user are <em>one-way</em> <a href="../Metadata_Objects/External Services/defining an interface operation.html">operations</a>. The replies that the user sends to the process are <em>notification</em> operations.</p>
<p>For example, a User Participant <em>Approver</em> can be defined that has an interface with three Operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>credit check</em>: one-way</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>approved</em>: notification</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>rejected</em>: notification</li>
</ul>
<p>This interface definition allows the process to send only <em>credit</em><em>check</em> requests to the User Participant, and allows the User Participant to reply with either an <em>approved</em> or <em>rejected</em> message.</p>
<p>Unlike message exchanges performed when invoking external service interfaces, interaction with a User Participant do not involve data exchange, but rather an indication of what operation to perform, through the use of an operation name. In the example above, when the process sends a <em>credit</em><em>check</em> request, it does not send any data with the request. The process data (Process Order and Process Document) is available for any user task that this process requests.</p>

<p>Process Management implements user tasks through a worklist queue. The product User Interface (order management system) displays all current user tasks in a list, allowing the user to select tasks to work on. Every task in the list has an operation column that indicates the kind of task it is (such as <em>credit</em> <em>check</em> in the example above). When the user opens a particular task to work on, all <em>notification</em> type operations (for this task participant type, in our example <em>approved</em> and <em>rejected</em>) are automatically made available to the users through an action menu.</p>
<h3>User Participant Privilege</h3>
<p>To allow certain manual tasks to be performed only by specific users, the Process Management product assigns user privileges to User Participants. User privileges are a user right, assigned to a user, specifying allowable actions in the system. User privileges are defined and assigned to the user in the <a href="../../User Profile Manager User Guide/Create/user.html">User Profile Management</a> application.</p>
<p>For example, we can define a <em>credit approval</em> privilege for the participant in the above example, allowing only users with this privilege to perform the <em>credit</em> <em>check</em> tasks.</p>
<p>Since users can have a number of user privileges assigned to them, users can perform any user participant task (operation) according to the privileges that the user possesses.</p>
<h3>Task Effort</h3>
<p>Every manual task should be assigned with an effort metric in the <b>Effort</b> field on the <b>General</b> tab. This metric is used to calculate the current load for each user (the sum of all efforts for the currently assigned tasks). The system distribution type uses effort metrics to decide to whom to assign tasks.</p>
<h3><a name="distribution"></a>User Participant Tasks Distribution</h3>
<p>When a process sends a task to a User Participant (invoking one of the <em>one-way</em> operations of the participant interface), these tasks are added to the global worklist queue, but not assigned to any specific user. The User Participant properties have a distribution type attribute which specifies how manual tasks should be assigned to users. This is defined by the <b>Distribution type</b> field on the <b>General</b> tab.</p>
<p>The Process Management product supports the following distribution types:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Manual</em><b>:</b> The worklist manager assigns these tasks to each user manually. The worklist manager is a user with the <em>Worklist Administrator</em> <a href="../../User Profile Manager User Guide/Create/privilege.html">privilege</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Shared</em><b>:</b> Users with the appropriate privilege can get new tasks by clicking the <b>Get Task</b> button on the user interface. The tasks with the highest priority will be selected first.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>System</em><b>:</b> The Process Management product automatically assigns tasks to users with the appropriate privilege. This method of distribution uses effort metrics to decide which user gets the next task. The system automatically assigns the next task to the user with the lesser load (sum of all efforts for the currently assigned tasks) that does not exceed the user's maximum effort defined in the <a href="../../User Profile Manager User Guide/Create/user.html">User Profile Manager</a>. The user must log in at least once to start receiving tasks. When a user logs in or completes a task and this user's current load becomes less than a minimum effort defined in User Profile Manager, the system automatically assigns the next task to the user.</li>
</ul>
<h3>User Participant Task Duration</h3>
<p>The User Participant definition includes duration values for every task that the User Participant can perform (<em>one-way</em> operations), and duration values used for calculating task due dates. These values are defined in the <b>Duration</b> section of the <b>General</b> tab.</p>
<p>Due date calculation is based on the <a href="../../User Profile Manager User Guide/Create/calendar.html">calendar</a> specified in the User Profile Manager that is applied to the User Participant. Calendars specify working hours in 15 minutes increments; this allows weekends and holidays to be taken into account for due date calculations. For example, a task that is assigned on Friday afternoon with a duration of 8 hours would have a due date of Monday afternoon (assuming that Saturday and Sunday are a non-working weekend).</p>
<p>The User Interface shows tasks sorted by due dates (with the closest dates on top), and  overdue tasks display in red.</p>
<h3>User Participant General Properties</h3>
<p>The general User Participant properties are defined on the <b>General</b> tab. </p>

<p><strong>Important</strong>: If you configured the User Participant for Automated processes, the General tab appearance is different than if the User Participant was set for manual. In addition, the Interface, Orders and Methods tab does not appear for that User Participant configuration.</p>

<h3>User Participant Interface Tab</h3>
<p>The <b>Interface</b> tab of the User Participant is used to define an Interface for interaction between a process and a user. For example,  the tasks that can be assigned to the user and all the actions the user can perform on the assigned tasks.</p>

<img src="userParticipantInterface.png" align="absmiddle" border="1" alt="User participant - Interface tab" />

<p>The Interface can be selected from the <b>Interface</b> list box, which lists pre-existing Interfaces. Once the Interface is defined for this User Participant, the <em>notification</em> Operations (those with an <b>Operation type</b> of <em>Notification</em> in <a href="../Metadata_Objects/External Services/defining an interface operation.html">Interface Operation</a>) will be listed in the <b>Operations and conditions</b> tree. For the selected Operation in the tree, the Operation condition properties are displayed on the right.</p>

<h3>User Participant Methods Tab</h3>

If   the returned string is an existing user, the worklist task is assigned to it. Otherwise, an error message appears. </p>
