<h2>User Worklist</h2>
<p>Based on configured processes, the user worklist displays a list of all user tasks that are assigned to the current user. The worklist user interface is instantiated using the <em>BaseWorklistFinder (Worklist)</em> found in the <strong>Templates</strong> tab &gt; <b>cwf_pm (Process Management Product)</b> &gt; <strong>Finders</strong> &gt; <strong>Document Finders</strong> folder. If a user has worklist tasks assigned to him or her, the application menu (top right corner) displays the number of worklist tasks and an icon <img src="worklist_icon.png" align="absmiddle" border="0" alt="" /> indicating whether user is Available or Unavailable. Clicking the icon or the task number opens the  Worklist Finder specified on the Application User Interface element.</p>

<h3>Displaying Details</h3>
<p>You can display the details for a worklist item by doing one of the following actions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>double-click the action in the worklist row.</li>
  <li>click the arrow icon located at the beginning of the row for the action that you want to view the details.</li>
</ul>
<p>The worklist user interface has a <strong>Task</strong> drop-down menu that contains actions that correspond to data displayed in the Worklist. </p>
<h3>Working With Tasks</h3>
<p>When a process sends a task to a User Participant, these tasks are   added to the global worklist queue, but not assigned to any specific user. The   User Participant properties have a <SPAN name="resultofMatch"><SPAN name="resultofMatch">distribut</SPAN>ion</SPAN> type attribute which   specifies how manual tasks should be assigned to users. This is defined by the <strong><SPAN name="resultofMatch"><SPAN name="resultofMatch">Distribut</SPAN>ion</SPAN> type</strong> field on the <strong>General</strong> tab.</p>
<p>There are several task settings available in the user interface  in a submenu titled <b>Task</b>. This submenu contains a list of all <em>notification</em>Operations defined for each participant. Clicking a task action  sends a message to the Process Engine and moves the item into the worklist archive (the user no longer sees this item in the worklist).  For example, when a user B takes a task  from user A, the acknowledge task appears in the user interface for user A to acknowledge this change.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Errors are generated when an action cannot be completed.</p>
