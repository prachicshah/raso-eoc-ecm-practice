<h2>Best Practices for Internationalization   </h2>
<p> When considering  internationalization, follow these design points:
<ul>
    <li>Minimize duplication in labels  to reduce translation effort.</li>
    <li>Allow labels to be inherited from  the variable level rather than specifying them at the form level.</li>
    <li>Use access rules to hide or enable  fields rather than new forms to reduce the translation effort.</li>
    <li>Avoid the use of plain text in  rules. Instead, use code that can be translated.</li>
    <li>Use substitution parameters in  rules to reduce the number of different messages.</li>
    <li>Create a central registry of error  messages using the resource editor, to ensure that messages are reused.</li>
    <li>If appropriate, define  translations for the general language (for example, en-xx) and omit translations  for the specific language (for example, en-ca, which is not appropriate for all languages).</li>
    <li>Model the solution in the  primary or most common language for the solution.</li>
    <li>Where template customizations  consist primarily in relabeling fields, consider using the Resources tab to  change the labels, rather than overriding or changing the underlying template.</li>
  </ul>
 <h3>Error Messages</h3>
<p>Error  messages are defined by text or by code. While in either case, the resulting  message can be internationalized, code based error messages are preferable.
  <ul>
    <li>The Resources tab provides a  central location to manage all error messages, rather than navigating to all  data element, document, and order validation rules.</li>
    <li>The use of code provides an  opportunity to reuse of messages, thereby reducing the translation  effort.</li>
    <li>The use of code allows the  message parameter substitution capability to be used, reducing the  translation effort (for example, a message defined as <tt>No value in mandatory field {0}</tt> requires one translation for the  message, with an additional one for each variable label, rather than one message and one label for each variable).</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Generated Text</h3> 
   <p> Avoid  using non-metadata-based text within the solution, such as rules that are generated. This  text is not visible to the Resources tab and cannot be internationalized. Common  situations include the following: 
    <ul>
      <li>Computed form fields</li>
    <li>Visual keys</li>
    <li>Browser window title  (application name)</li>
</ul>
 Where  text is desired within these fields, these basic means exist to provide  internationalization:
  <ul>
    <li>The Resources tab's error code  translation facility may be used to create an error code with the associated  text. The script may generate the translated value directly by generating an error code and using <tt>Global._translateText() </tt>to return the translated text, which is the recommended mode when the resulting text is appended to other  values or text.</li>
    <li>A data type may be defined  containing an enumerated list of codes and labels. The product would then be used to  translate the enumeration. The script may generate the translated value  directly by generating a code, and using <tt>Global._getCodeDescription()</tt>to return the translated text for the code.</li>
    <li>Similar to the previous method,  if the target field is defined with the enumeration as the base type, the  translated description is automatically generated by the product, which is the recommended approach where the resulting  text is the final text.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The generated text should  be transient in nature, which means it should be  recalculated on each view. If it is persisted and not recalculated,  a user from  another locale  will see the original translation and not the translation  appropriate for the locale.</p>
  <h3>Field Labels</h3> 
   <p> Field  labels within the product follow an inheritance.  If the form label is not specified, the variable's visual label is used, which can be defined using the <strong>Element Properties</strong> field. To reduce the effort in translation, use the default label wherever possible.</p>
      <ul>
    <li>Specification of labels at the  form level requires additional effort in the initial modelling, especially where  multiple forms are defined that include the same variables.</li>
    <li>Changes to the labels assigned to  the underlying variables are not be automatically propagated to the forms.</li>
    <li>Internationalization is  complicated as the translation effort is performed for each form, not only at the variable level.</li>
    <li>Even where form field labels are  appropriate, consider using the variable's visual  label for the most common label and specifying the form field labels only  for the exceptions.</li>
  </ul>
      <h3> Business Data </h3>
<p>    Where  business data translation is required (for example, with reference tables), it  is the responsibility of the designer to provide translation facilities and to  invoke them.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>For example, a separate table  may be created and managed to hold the translations by language (see Catalog  Management or the core product’s code tables).</li>
    <li>Catalog Management can be used  to manage these tables, which is the recommended approach for dynamic data.</li>
    <li>Product's code tables can be  used to manage these tables, which is the recommended approach for static  data.</li>
