	      <h3>The Concept of Metadata</h3>
		<p>Applications are not written in Java, C#, C++ or 
		 any other third generation language. Instead they are non-procedural 
		 specifications of the application logic; look and feel generated 
		 in an XML-based language called Application Markup 
		 Language, or AML. Historically, to make the concept of 
		 AML more easily understandable, we refer to the AML specifications 
		 as metadata -- information that describes the data. Although not 
		 entirely correct in the given context, the term metadata gained 
		 popularity with users. We found it useful because it properly 
		 conveys the difference between the traditional products written 
		 in 3GL and the non-procedural interpretive applications. 
		 In this document we will be using the term metadata as a synonym 
		 to AML specification - an open XML based document that describes 
		 an order entry/order management application.</p>
		<p>AML specifications (or metadata) are not created as text files 
		 using a general purpose XML editor. Instead, the product provides a powerful point-and-click graphic tool called the 
		 Velocity Studio that creates and modifies the metadata.
