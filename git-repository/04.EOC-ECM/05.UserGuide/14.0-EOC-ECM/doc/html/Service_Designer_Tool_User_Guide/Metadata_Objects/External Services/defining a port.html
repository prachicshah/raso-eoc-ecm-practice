<h3>Defining a Port</h3>
<p>A port represents a single endpoint defined as a combination of a Binding and a network address (location). A port can be added directly under an External Service element.</p>
<p>To create a new port, do the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Right-click the<b> External Services</b> folder in a Namespace and select <b>New Port</b>.</li>
  <li>The New Port dialog appears. Enter the <strong>Name</strong> of the port (must conform to JavaScript naming conventions), select the <strong>Binding</strong>, and populate other fields, as necessary. </li>
  <li>Click the <b>Finish</b> button.</li>
</ol>

<p>After you have created your port, its icon appears in the  <b>External Services</b> folder, under your External Service element.</p>

<h4>Port General Properties</h4>
<p>The  port's <b>General</b> tab defines general port properties. </p>

<p><img src="Port.png" border="0" alt="Port - General Properties" /></p>
<p>The following table describes the property fields in the port's General tab:</p>
<table class='confluenceTable' border cellpadding="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th class='confluenceTh'>Field</th>
<th class='confluenceTh'>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='confluenceTd'><b>Name</b></td>
<td class='confluenceTd'>Mandatory. Name of the port within the namespace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='confluenceTd'><b>Label</b></td>
<td class='confluenceTd'>Mandatory. Label to identify the port.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='confluenceTd'><b>Description</b></td>
<td class='confluenceTd'>Description of the port for documentation purposes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='confluenceTd'><b>Listener</b></td>
<td class='confluenceTd'><p>If checked, this port is a listener port. This option will be enabled only when the service provider supports listening. Selection of this option will make the <b>Backup port</b> field invisible in the User Interface and their settings will be ignored by the runtime system. Selection of this option will also replace the calendar field with the Script field.</p>
  <p>When you define a port as a listener, you can create cwOnApi<em>xxx</em>Error methods to handle exceptions for error processing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If your API script on a listener port has a try-catch and does not have a rethrow exception, the predefined on<em>xxx</em>error does not get invoked.</li>
    <li>There is no on<em>xxx</em>error method that is a catch-all.</li>
    <li>If you define a new  method, it does not get processed. Only the following methods are processed:
      <ul>
        <li>cwOnApiConnectionError</li>
        <li>cwOnApiBusinessError</li>
        <li>cwOnApiExternalError</li>
        <li>cwOnApiSecurityError</li>
        <li>cwOnApiInternalError</li>
        <li>cwOnApiUnknownError</li>
        <li>cwCategorizeApiError </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    </ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class='confluenceTd'><b>Message on fault</b></td>
  <td class='confluenceTd'><p>This property appears under all these conditions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>Listener</strong> property is unchecked</li>
      <li>The <strong>Binding</strong> field is not empty</li>
      <li>The binding uses either the SOAP or HTTP service provider</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If an <em>AxisFault</em> is received from the SOAP service, the framework will try to populate its data into the data structure specified in <b>Fault</b> of the interface operation definition. When unchecked, an <em>AxisFault</em> will throw a CwfException and the error stack trace will be in the Event Log (the stack trace is limited to 1024 characters).</p>
    <p>When <strong>Message on fault</strong> is enabled on a SOAP external interface, if an operation is at fault, the Fault data structure defined returns a fault message.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class='confluenceTd'><strong>Export schema inside wsdl</strong></td>
  <td class='confluenceTd'>This property appears only when you have selected the <strong>Listener</strong> property. By default, the <strong>Export schema inside wsdl</strong> property is unchecked. When selected, this property exposes a flat WSDL (that is, with embedded schemas) for a SOAP interface. When you access the WSDL from the Web, a list of schemas displays.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class='confluenceTd'><b>Calendar</b></td>
  <td class='confluenceTd'><p>Specifies an optional calendar that is used to determine service availability. If no calendar is specified in the <b>Calendar</b> field, the service is considered available at all times. When a calendar is specified in the <b>Calendar</b> field, the service is considered available only during the <em>working</em> slots of the calendar. When the framework needs to perform a particular Interface Operation, it selects the first port that implements the Interface and that is currently available. </p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> <a href="../../../User Profile Manager User Guide/Create/calendar.html">Calendars</a> are defined and managed in the System Administration application, and the enumeration of these selections in Velocity Studio are defined by the <i>cwf.allCalendars</i> Data Type.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class='confluenceTd'><strong>Script</strong></td>
  <td class='confluenceTd'>Appears when listener is checked. Allows for specification of a script to be used to process the request. Provided as an
    alternative to specifying a separate Javascript port and binding.<br>
    Two arguments are passed to the script:<br>
    Argument 1: input: the data received by the listener<br>
    Argument 2: operation: the name of the interface operation handling the request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class='confluenceTd'><b>Binding</b></td>
  <td class='confluenceTd'>Specifies the port binding that determines the Service Provider and all concrete details necessary to interact with the service.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class='confluenceTd'><strong>URL Mapping</strong></td>
  <td class='confluenceTd'><p>This field appears when you select the <strong>Listener</strong> field. This field can only be set for HTTP listener ports and is validated the same way as a user interface application URL mapping. The value specified in this field represents a URL path that is to be mapped to the port (listener). This value replaces the current hard-coded interface name in the URL.</p>
    <p>The URL path can contain multiple path items. However, it must begin with / (for example, /portA). The URL path supports a wildcard (*). However, the wildcard character must be at the end and is only supported as the full path element. As an example, /a/b/* is valid, but /a/b* is not. If a wildcard is not specified, the request's full URL path must match the value.</p></td>
</tr>
<!-- <tr>
<td class='confluenceTd'><b>Address</b></td>
<td class='confluenceTd'>A list that provides the physical location of the service. The <b>Address</b> attributes are determined by the service provider class. To define the <b>Address</b> attribute values, click the <b>Change</b><b>Values</b> button. The <b>Attributes</b> dialog (see figure below) will open showing the appropriate fields depending on the attribute type. Note: Refer to section on Built-in Service Providers for specific information on <b>Address</b> attributes and the values that each service provider supports.</td>
</tr> -->

<p>There are more port settings of the external service to be configured in <a href="../../../Configuration_Tool_User_Guide/Services Services.html">Configuration application's Service page</a>. These settings are instance-specific and thus to be configured in Configuration application only, and not available to be configured in the metadata or Velocity Studio. Furthermore, some of these settings in the Configuration application, such as <i>Address attributes</i>, are service provider-specific (the port properties are as per the service provider class). Refer to the corresponding section in <a href="../Built-in Service Providers/built-in service providers.html">Built-in Service Providers</a> for specific information on port attributes and the values that each service provider supports.
