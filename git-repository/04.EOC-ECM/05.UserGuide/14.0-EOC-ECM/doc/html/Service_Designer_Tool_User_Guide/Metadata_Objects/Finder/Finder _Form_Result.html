<h2>Finder Result Form</h2>
<p>The <strong>Finder Result Form</strong> specifies how the output Document is presented in the Finder User Interface.  The Default Form element representation of the variables under the output document (that is, a boolean type variable is represented by a checkbox by default) are automatically added to the Result Form. The system  populates the fields that are displayed under the table element  using the variables defined in the User Interface. When the Finder output document is changed the system automatically changes the corresponding Result Form. </p>
<p><img src="Finder_Result_Form.png" border="1" alt="Finder Result Form" /></p>
<p>Each Form element in the Result Form can be configured using the Form element properties. For example, you can configure the Variable property to bind to a variable in the User Interface. </p>
<p><img src="Finder_results_example.png" align="absmiddle" border="1" alt="Finder Results Example" /></p>
<p>The variable references data in this  Document and returns the value to the field which is displayed in the Result Form at runtime.  </p>

</p>
The result form is also used to download data related  to the finder table. The selected download methods look in to the result form and  attempt to find the <a href="../../Velocity_Studio/Element - Table.html">table element</a>. But you cannot download the results when a  finder's result form belongs to another user interface (no Table element  related to the result form of the finder), and the <a href="../Top-levelUI/Top-Level UI.html#Download"> download</a> functionality  of a finder user interface is overwritten. In this scenario, to specify which  user interface to use to look up the result table, the download functionality  can be used to <a href="../../../FAQ/FAQ.html#q12"> create download object </a>through application user interface script.  The download object contains <em>resultUI</em> and <em>resultForm</em> variables that can be set  in the script.
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li> For the Results data at  runtime, the table column sort (ascending/descending) functionality is available at any time. You do not need to wait for all data for that particular Finder to have been retrieved from the server to perform a sort.</li>
  <li>If there are any  validation errors in the user interface and the <a href="../../Velocity_Studio/Element - Table.html"> table element</a> is used, the errors  are shown as soon as finder is displayed at runtime.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Edit In Table</h3>
<p>The <strong>Edit in table</strong> option is available in the Table Form element.  The <strong>Editable</strong> property  defines if the user is allowed to edit the data of that Finder through the Table element during runtime. The property provides a list of permission-based methods that set the permissions of the table. For each checkbox Form element in the Result Form, set the Toggle Edit property to true. If you have overridden the <em>OnSelChanged</em> method (from the Methods tab of the User Interface) ensure that the super implementation is called or the toggle edit functionality will not function properly.</p>
<h3>Select All Visible Rows in a Finder</h3>
<p>You can select all  visible rows of a finder to action. You can use the following two script methods:</p>
<ul>
  <li>selectAllRecords(), which selects all fetched records in the table</li>
  <li>deselectAllRecords(), which deselects all records in the table</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The selectAllRecords() method respects any user-applied   filters</li>
  <li>Any changes made to the finder result after selecting all records must   occur in a separate user action</li>
  </ul>
<p>The following is an example on how to use the two methods:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a finder with a  filter, which has some records in the finder result.</li>
  <li>Create a user action   containing this.result.selectAllRecords script. Proceed to bind this user action to a   <strong>Select All</strong> menu.</li>
  <li> Filter the finder result and then click the <strong>Select All</strong>   menu. All filtered records are selected.</li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Delete</strong>   menu to delete the selected records. Only filtered records are   deleted and other records remain in the table result.</li>
  </ol>
<h3>Browser-side Filtering</h3>
<p>You can provide the results of browser-side filtering to the finder. The finder's current list continues to represent the full finder results. A new method, filteredList(), is provided to exposed the filtered list. </p>
<p>The following is an example on how to use the filteredList() method:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Create one finder table bound to the   result variable.</li>
  <li> In the same form, create another table bound to a   variable and call it <strong>filtered</strong>.</li>
  <li> Create a button in the same form that has   a click method with similar script functionality. The following is an example for reference:
    
    <div class="preformatted">
<div class="preformattedContent">
<pre>
var f = this.result.filteredList;

this.filtered = new DataObjectList();
if(this.result.filteredList!=null && this.result.filteredList.length > 0){
  var i = 0;
  for(i=0;i&#8249;f.length;i++){
  this.filtered.addLast(f[i]);
  }
}
this.filtered.updateList;</pre></div>
</div>
  </li>
  <li>At runtime, click <strong>Search</strong>, add a filter value, then click the <strong>Filter</strong> icon. </li>
  <li> Click  the button that you created in step 3. The second table bound to the filtered   variable contains the same records as the table from step 1.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Search</strong>, and then click the button from step 3. The table from step 2 is    empty because there is no filter set.<BR>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>For any item in the current list, the isFiltered() method is available that indicates whether the item is in the filtered list. The following is an example on how to use the this.result.isFiltered() method:
  </p>
<ol>
  <li> Create an integer variable under the Finder   User Interface.</li>
  <li>Using the form in the previous example, add a textfield bound to the integer   variable from step 1.</li>
  <li> Add a button with a click method that has similar script functionality. The following is an example for reference:
  
  <div class="preformatted">
<div class="preformattedContent">
<pre>
Global.showUserMessage(this.result.isFiltered(this.result[this.Integer]));
</pre></div>
</div>
   
  </li>
  <li>At runtime, click <strong>Search</strong>, add a filter value, then click the <strong>Filter</strong> icon. </li>
  <li>Enter a row number, and then click the button from step 3. This button displays a popup showing either true or false, depending on your filter settings.<BR>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Return the Result Form Dynamically</h3>
<p>The ui_common.baseFinder base UI for finders allows for returning the result form dynamically. To use this functionality, ensure that you do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your metadata overrides the getResultForm method of ui_common.baseFinder.</li>
  <li>The getResultForm method returns the top-level UI (that is, name) that extends ui_common.baseResult. As an example, for cwa_admin.findEventLog, the getResultForm method publishes an event to get the result form UI (top-level UI), so that your  metadata can provide its own handler and return the extended UI.</li>
  <li>The  getResultForm method can have any custom logic. As an example, it can be used to dynamically choose what result form to display based on the first row from the result list. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>    Note:</strong> The getResultForm method is not invoked every time when a search occurs. It is usually called once when changing finder views. </li>
</ul>
