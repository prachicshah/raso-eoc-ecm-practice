<h2><a name=""></a>User Role Selection</h2>
<p>When users log in and belong to multiple user groups, they can select one user group as their active one. Selecting an active user group means that only those privileges associated with that user group are applied to their user account.</p>
<p>On the login page, a reference finder is available, allowing users to select their user group. The reference finder is invisible by default. However, it is visible only if users override the login document and reset the <strong>Visible</strong> permission.</p>
<p>In runtime, users have the following two options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Users enter their username and password, and then log in. All privileges associated with the user groups that they belong to are added to their username.</li>
  <li>Users can employ the reference finder to select arbitrary groups. After they log in, only privileges belonging to the selected user group are added to their username.</li>
</ul>
