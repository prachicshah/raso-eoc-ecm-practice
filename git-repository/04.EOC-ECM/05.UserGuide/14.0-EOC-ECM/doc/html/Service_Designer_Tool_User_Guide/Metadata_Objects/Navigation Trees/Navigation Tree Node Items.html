<h2>Navigation Tree Node Items</h2>

<p>All node types of Navigation Tree, except Recursive Nodes, may define children nodes in the metadata. (Recursive Nodes may have children nodes at runtime, but they are defined at the metadata of the associated Recursive Tree Node.) The <b>Navigation Tree Items</b> tab in Root Node, and the <b>Tree Node Items</b> tab in Tree Node, Finder Node and Finder Child Node contains the list of children nodes. The two aforementioned tabs are equivalent; only the tab label is different based on the node type.</p>

<p>The children nodes appear according to their order in the list, from top to bottom, in both Velocity Studio's Navigation Pane, as well as Tree Form Element at runtime. The arrow buttons located at the side of the list are used to move the selected element in the list to the desired order.</p>
