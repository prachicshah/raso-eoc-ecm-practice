<h2>Compare Metadata</h2>

<p>Velocity Studio allows you to view the differences between two metadata projects. To use the metadata comparison tool, complete these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>In Velocity Studio, ensure that you have <a href="Open Project.html">opened a project</a> that will be compared with another project.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>From the menu bar, click <strong>File &gt; Compare</strong>. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>A dialog appears, prompting you to select the directory in which your second project is located. Once you have selected your project directory, click the <strong>Open</strong> button to launch the <strong>Compare Metadata</strong> page.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="compareOpenProject.png" alt="Select project metadata to be compared with current project metadata"><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The <strong>Compare Metadata</strong> screen appears:<br>
    <br>
    <img src="compareMetadata.png" alt="Compare Metadata page"><br>
<br>
The page contains the following sections:<br>
<br>
<table width="610" border="1">
  <tr>
    <th width="75" class='referenceTh'>Pane</th>
    <th width="519" class='referenceTh'>Description</th>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Source</strong></td>
    <td>This pane shows the current project's metadata tree. You can right-click any metadata object and select <strong>Properties</strong> to view its properties.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Difference</strong></td>
    <td><p>This pane contains a metadata tree containing three nodes:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Added</strong> - node contains all top-level metadata that does not exist in the current metadata project.
        <li><strong>Deleted</strong> - node contains all top-level metadata objects that no longer exist in the secondary metadata project.
        <li><strong>Modified</strong> - node contains all top-level metadata objects that are different in the two projects. You can expand each top-level metadata object node in the Modified pane to view which of its children are different. 
Specifically, this pane contains  all modified property elements of top-level metadata objects, including children, methods, and the user interface.</p></ul></td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Target</strong></td>
    <td>This pane shows the secondary project's metadata tree. You can right-click any metadata object and select <strong>Properties</strong> to view its properties.</td>
    </tr>
</table>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>It is not possible to have two simultaneous AVMs. The source metadata is located in the first AVM that was created, which refers to objects in the second AVM that was created.</li>
  <li>If no projects have been opened in Velocity Studio, the <strong>Compare</strong> option under the <strong>File</strong> option is disabled.Â  </li>
  <li>When you select a modified property element, the old  and   new values appear  in the detail panel under the <strong>Difference</strong> pane.</li>
  <li>When you select a modified element, the <strong>Detail</strong> button is enabled. Click this button to open the <strong>Detail</strong> panel, showing both the old and new values in a split screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p></td>
</tr>
