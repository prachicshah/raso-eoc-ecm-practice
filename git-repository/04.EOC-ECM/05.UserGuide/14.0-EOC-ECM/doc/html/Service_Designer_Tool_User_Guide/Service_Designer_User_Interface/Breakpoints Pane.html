<p>The Breakpoints Pane is located at the bottom-right of Velocity Studio as the <b>Breakpoints</b> tab, which provides a list of all scripts in Velocity Studio that have breakpoints set.</p>
<p>In this example, breakpoints have been set in unnamed.script using the JavaScript debugger.  </p>
<p><img src="breakpointsPaneDebugger.png" alt="Debugger - set breakpoint" border="1"> </p>
<p>The script name also appears in the Breakpoint pane, listing it as a a script that contains at least one breakpoint. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can double-click the script link in the Breakpoints tab, to open the script and set the focus  to the   corresponding object or function.</p>

></p>
<p>When you close the JavaScript debugger, you can clear breakpoints in a script. Right-click the script that you want and select from one of the following options:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Clear Breakpoint</strong> to clear a specific breakpoint set in your script. </li>
  <li><strong>Clear All Breakpoints</strong> to clear all breakpoints set in your script.</li>
  </ul>
<p><img src="breakpointsPaneScriptClearBreakpoints.png" alt="Breakpoints pane - clear breakpoints" border="1"></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can click the <strong>Clear Breakpoint</strong> (<img src="breakpointsRemoveBreakpointButton.png" width="24" height="24" alt="Clear Breakpoint button">) and <strong>Clear All Breakpoints </strong>(<img src="breakpointsRemoveAllBreakpoints.png" width="26" height="24" alt="Clear All Breakpoints button">) buttons.</p>
