			<h2>Accessibility and Section 508 Compliance</h2>
		<p> In the United States, <a href="http://www.section508.gov/" target="_blank">Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act</a> mandates that Web content be made accessible to people with disabilities. Section 508 is a statutory amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Section 508 issues are, for the most part, parallel to <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources/#ch" target="_blank">W3C Priority One</a> issues. Although Section 508 and  W3C Priority One have subtle differences, and implementing them require different approaches, the checkpoints are similar.</p>
		<p>The product fulfills the following technical standards under Section 508, Subpart B -- Technical Standards:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li><a href="#software">§ 1194.21 Software applications and operating systems</a></li>
		  <li><a href="#web">§ 1194.22 Web-based intranet and internet information and applications</a></li>
		  </ul>
		<p>For more information on SmartClient technology and its compliance to Section 508, see <a href="http://www.smartclient.com/docs/8.2/a/b/c/go.html#group..accessibility" target="_blank">SmartClient's Accessibility / 508 compliance</a> page.</p>
		<p>When creating Web applications, keep these standards in mind during development, as there is always the possibility of violating accessibility standards.</p>
<h3><a name="software"></a>§ 1194.21 Software applications and operating systems</h3>
        <p>(a) When software is designed to run on a system that has a keyboard,   product functions shall be executable from a keyboard where the   function itself or the result of performing a function can be discerned   textually. </p>
        <p>(b) Applications shall not disrupt or disable activated features of   other products that are identified as accessibility features, where   those features are developed and documented according to industry   standards. Applications also shall not disrupt or disable activated   features of any operating system that are identified as accessibility   features where the application programming interface for those   accessibility features has been documented by the manufacturer of the   operating system and is available to the product developer. </p>
        <p>(c) A well-defined on-screen indication of the current focus shall be   provided that moves among interactive interface elements as the input   focus changes. The focus shall be programmatically exposed so that   assistive technology can track focus and focus changes. </p>
        <p>(d) Sufficient information about a user interface element including   the identity, operation and state of the element shall be available to   assistive technology. When an image represents a program element, the   information conveyed by the image must also be available in text. </p>
        <p>(e) When bitmap images are used to identify controls, status   indicators, or other programmatic elements, the meaning assigned to   those images shall be consistent throughout an application's   performance. </p>
        <p>(f) Textual information shall be provided through operating system   functions for displaying text. The minimum information that shall be   made available is text content, text input caret location, and text   attributes. </p>
        <p>(g) Applications shall not override user selected contrast and color selections and other individual display attributes. </p>
        <p>(h) When animation is displayed, the information shall be displayable   in at least one non-animated presentation mode at the option of the   user. </p>
        <p>(i) Color coding shall not be used as the only means of conveying   information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or   distinguishing a visual element. </p>
        <p>(j) When a product permits a user to adjust color and contrast   settings, a variety of color selections capable of producing a range of   contrast levels shall be provided. </p>
        <p>(k) Software shall not use flashing or blinking text, objects, or   other elements having a flash or blink frequency greater than 2 Hz and   lower than 55 Hz. </p>
        <p>(l) When electronic forms are used, the form shall allow people using   assistive technology to access the information, field elements, and   functionality required for completion and submission of the form,   including all directions and cues.  </p>
<h3><a name="web"></a>§ 1194.22 Web-based intranet and internet information and applications</h3>
        <p>(a) A text equivalent for every non-text element shall be provided (for example, via "alt", "longdesc", or in element content). </p>
        <p>(b) Equivalent alternatives for any multimedia presentation shall be synchronized with the presentation. </p>
        <p>(c) Web pages shall be designed so that all information conveyed with   color is also available without color, for example from context or   markup. </p>
        <p>(d) Documents shall be organized so they are readable without requiring an associated style sheet. </p>
        <p>(e) Redundant text links shall be provided for each active region of a server-side image map. </p>
        <p>(f) Client-side image maps shall be provided instead of server-side   image maps except where the regions cannot be defined with an available   geometric shape. </p>
        <p>(g) Row and column headers shall be identified for data tables. </p>
        <p>(h) Markup shall be used to associate data cells and header cells for   data tables that have two or more logical levels of row or column   headers. </p>
        <p>(i) Frames shall be titled with text that facilitates frame identification and navigation. </p>
        <p>(j) Pages shall be designed to avoid causing the screen to flicker with a frequency greater than 2 Hz and lower than 55 Hz. </p>
        <p>(k) A text-only page, with equivalent information or functionality,   shall be provided to make a web site comply with the provisions of this   part, when compliance cannot be accomplished in any other way. The   content of the text-only page shall be updated whenever the primary page   changes. </p>
        <p>(l) When pages utilize scripting languages to display content, or to   create interface elements, the information provided by the script shall   be identified with functional text that can be read by assistive   technology.        </p>
        <p>(n) When electronic forms are designed to be completed on-line, the   form shall allow people using assistive technology to access the   information, field elements, and functionality required for completion   and submission of the form, including all directions and cues. </p>
        <p>(o) A method shall be provided that permits users to skip repetitive navigation links. </p>
        <p>(p) When a timed response is required, the user shall be alerted and given sufficient time to indicate more time is required.      </p>
