<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>Image click may be enabled in two different ways. One way is to set a <b>Click Method</b> property. The other is to set a <b>Link URL</b> property. Click Method takes precedence if both are provided.</p>
<p>*If this element is the first element that appears in the Element Tree pane, you can set the cell alignment. If this element has a parent layout, for example vlayout or hlayout with the width/height set, this element uses these values as a base to set its alignment. If the parent layout does not contain a width/height, then this element does not have a base to which it can set its alignment.
If the element has a parent that contains width/height settings, but this form is displayed under another layout with different widths, your form alignment is restricted to the parent's width/height settings.</p>
