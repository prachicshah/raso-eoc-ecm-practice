<h2>Large Text Area</h2>

<p>The Large Text Area element enables the user to add text to a scrolling text box via a dialog text editor at runtime. The summary of the content entered in this dialog text box will appear in the Large Text Area   as  read only. The number of summary characters displayed is based on user-defined value of the Summary Length property. </p>
<p>The Large Text element and the Large Text Area elements contain similar properties. The Large Text element enables content to be displayed in a textbox or a single line of content, whereas the Large Text Area allows content to be displayed in a scrolling textbox (with potentially many lines of content).  Both these elements are only available under Document User Interface.</p>

<img src="exampleLargeTextArea.png" alt="Large Text Area" border="1">

<p>At runtime, the user clicks on the Large Text Area icon to open up the Dialog Text Editor for text entry.  Once the user has entered in text into the Dialog Text Editor and save their work, the Textbox will display a summary of the entered text. The summary will contain text entered in the Dialog Text Editor to a maximum number of characters as defined by the value entered in the Summary Length property.</p>
