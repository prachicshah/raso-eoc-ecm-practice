<h2>Large Text</h2>

<p>The Large Text Form element enables you to add text into the property summary field, and display it in a dialog box. The property summary  displays  a  read only summary of the text, based on user-defined settings. Users sets the property summary length, which is applied to the text and displayed in preview mode. Based on permission settings, the text displays in the dialog box as read only or editable. </p>

<p>In addition, the Large Text element can be structured inside of a table (see the following properties, Can Sort, Start Row, Cell Row Span, Cell Column Span, Group by In Table).</p>
