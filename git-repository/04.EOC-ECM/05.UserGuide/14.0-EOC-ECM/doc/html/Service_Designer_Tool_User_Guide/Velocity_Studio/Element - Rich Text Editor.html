<h2>Rich Text Editor</h2>

<p>The Rich Text Editor element enables you to create an area to perform rich text editing, such as making changes to your text's font, colour, size, alignment, and more. This element is available as an input form element.</p>
<p>The properties of the Rich Text Editor element are similar to the <a href="Element - Text Area.html">Text Area</a> element, except for the <strong>Control Options</strong> property, which lets you specify which groups of controls that you want to include in the editor's toolbar. </p>
<p>The following example shows the editing area for editing text. A <strong>Set Canvas HTML</strong> button has also be created in this example. When you click this button, your text that you have worked on in the editor appears in the viewing area under the editor itself.</p>

    <p>By default, this field is set to 1. All nine positions are made available for the <strong>Cell Alignment</strong> property if the form element is under a Grid Layout element and has a row span greater than 1, so that the form element can be aligned in nine different positions.
