<h2>Slider</h2>

<p>The Slider element contains a GUI slider widget that allows you to select a numeric value from within a range by dragging a visual indicator up and down a track. You can change the value by clicking the track, or clicking and dragging the thumb. </p>

<img src="exampleSlider.png"  alt="Numeric Slider Element" border="1">

<p>To use the Slider element, you need to initialize the value of the integer variable to assign to the Slider element, and give it a <strong>Maximum Value</strong> and a <strong>Minimum Value</strong>.</p>
