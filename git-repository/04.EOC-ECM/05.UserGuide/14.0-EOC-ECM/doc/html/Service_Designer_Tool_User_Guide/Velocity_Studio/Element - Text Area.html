<h2>Text Area</h2>

<p>The Text Area element enables you to create a large textbox with a label and icon within the User Interface. Various methods are associated with this element that enable you to invoke user actions (such as Run Trigger and On Enter). There are also various properties available to allow you to format the style and size of the Text Area element.  The example below displays a Text Area with a label, an icon, tooltip and a Text Box Style with a <em>blue bold </em> font style.</p>

<tr>
<th class='referenceTh'>Can Sort</th>
<td class='referenceTd'>Optional</td>
<td class='referenceTd'>This property is used when parented by a Table Element and refers to a Finder table column during runtime.  This will allow the user to sort the search results data by ascending or descending order at runtime. Setting this property to <em>False </em>will disable the sorting functionality. By default this functionality is set to <em>True.</em></td>

<tr>
<th class='referenceTh'>*Cell Alignment</th>
<td class='referenceTd'>Optional</td>
<td class='referenceTd'>Controls the horizontal and vertical positioning of the Text Area in the page or parent element. Default is undefined, which behaves as if it is top-left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th class='referenceTh'>Cell Column Span</th>
  <td class='referenceTd'>Optional</td>
  <td class='referenceTd'>Only applicable when in a Grid Layout. Specifies the number of columns that the Text Area occupies in the Grid Layout, to the right of the current cell. Default is empty, which means it occupies one column.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th class='referenceTh'>Cell Row Span</th>
  <td class='referenceTd'>Optional</td>
  <td class='referenceTd'><p>This property provides more flexibility when building a grid-based user interface, instead of using a combination of horizontal and vertical layouts. This property appears when form elements appear under a Grid Layout element and the form element has a parent element. This property specifies the number of rows that the element occupies in the grid layout.</p>
    <p>By default, this field is set to 1. All nine positions are made available for the <strong>Cell Alignment</strong> property if the form element is under a Grid Layout element and has a row span greater than 1, so that the form element can be aligned in nine different positions. With rowspan as 1, only the three centre positions are available.</p>
    <p>To use this property, see the <a href="Element - Button.html#cellRowSpanExample">example</a> for details.</p></td>

<th class='referenceTh'>Display Format</th>
<td class='referenceTd'>Optional</td>
<td class='referenceTd'>Specifies the accepted format that the Text Area will enforce and display at runtime. This property uses <em>regular expression</em> syntax to define the field length and allowable values.  For example, a Display Format property of "[\d]{3}" limits the user to enter a number of fixed length 3 (3 digit number) at runtime. The <em>regular expression</em> entered here must be of a fixed length containing a number (\d) or word character (\w). Default is empty which means there are no data restrictions. Another example of this property value would be &quot;[A-Za-z0-9]{9}&quot; which would result in any alphanumeric character that is 9 characters long. Note that the <em>square brackets </em>and parameter (<em>[ ]</em>)has to proceed the fixed length format and<em> curly brackets ({ }</em>).</td>

<th class='referenceTh'>Dynamic Label Style</th>
<td class='referenceTd'>Optional</td>
<td class='referenceTd'>The value of this property is a method with a Return type <em>String</em>.

  <p>When this element is  used under the Table element, the <strong> Dynamic Tooltip</strong> property accepts a script, which is called for each result document value bound to a field with a dynamic tooltip set. This script returns the string desired to be shown on the hover. Additionally, the property accepts a variable value belonging to the result document. The value for this variable is then used to display the tooltip.</p></td>

<th class='referenceTh'>Dynamic Tooltip Style</th>
<td class='referenceTd'>Optional</td>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> If a field contains  an editable permission that is either coming from the form field itself, or inherited  from the variable or data type, it takes precedence. Otherwise, the user  interface's editablePerm permission takes over. If this method is not  overwritten, the model's editablePerm permission is used.
