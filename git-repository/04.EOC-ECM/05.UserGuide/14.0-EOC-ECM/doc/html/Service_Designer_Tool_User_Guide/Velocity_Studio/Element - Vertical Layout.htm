<h2>Vertical Layout</h2>

<p>There are  three layout directives for user interface design:  
<ul>
  <li>Horizontal</li>
  <li>Vertical</li>
  <li> Grid</li>
  </ul>
<p> Vertical Layout presents child elements in a vertical stack.  The example below displays Credit Card information page with all credit card field elements displayed in a vertical layout. The user is able to specify the alignment of the elements relative to the page (for example, Right, Left, or Center). </p>

<tr>
  <th class='referenceTh'>Fill Space</th>
  <td class='referenceTd'>Optional</td>
  <td class='referenceTd'><p>Set this property to true if the  parent layout is needed to fill empty spaces with its children. For example, if  the parent layout is 100% height and 100% width, and its children combined either use  less than or more than 100%, the parent resizes its  children to use 100%. </p>
    <p>This property should not be set to true if the parent  layout requires a centered alignment. In general, when a  parent has one child and the parent's alignment is set to center, the child  should only  be moved to the centre position. However, if the parent is instructed to <em>fill space</em>, its child is  resized to fill the rest of the space  that is unoccupied.</p></td>

  <th class='referenceTh'>Include in Tab Order</th>
  <td class='referenceTd'>Optional</td>
  <td class='referenceTd'><p>This property allows you to optionally suppress tabbing to any or all form elements. The <strong>Include in Tab Order</strong> property overrides the <a href="../../Configuration_Tool_User_Guide/Configure/System/UI/UItabbing.html">suppress tabbing</a> configuration setting and can take the following values:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When set to <strong>&lt;Default&gt;</strong>, the element is included in tab order according to global rules and its focusable state.</li>

  <th class='referenceTh'>Members Margin</th>
  <td class='referenceTd'>Optional</td>
  <td class='referenceTd'> Specifies the number of spaces allowed between grid layouts in the layout stack.</td>

  <th class='referenceTh'>On Enter</th>
  <td class='referenceTd'>Optional</td>
  <td class='referenceTd'>The system calls any script defined in this property. The onEnter property is only met if there is an input field (for example, a textfield, selectfield, and so on) that has focus when the <strong>Enter</strong> key is pressed. This onEnter property is invoked only if the input field does not have an OnEnter property set.  This feature can be used with multiple input fields, but only  one onEnter method to fire for all fields. </td>

<tr>
  <th class='referenceTh'>Overflow</th>
  <td class='referenceTd'>Optional</td>
  <td class='referenceTd'><p>Defines how overflow child form elements are displayed based on the height of the layout. The default is Auto.</p>
    <p><strong>Auto</strong> - The child elements that do not fit within the height of the layout defined are shown via a scroll bar. The user can scroll across to see the children at runtime. In other words, the layout will scroll if the child members exceeds its specified size.</p>
    <p><strong>Hidden</strong> - The child elements that do not fit within the height of layout are NOT displayed at runtime.</p>
    <p><strong>Visible</strong> - If the child field element members size exceeds the specified layout size, the layout will grow to accommodate the child element members. </p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th class='referenceTh'>Redraw on resize</th>
  <td class='referenceTd'>Optional</td>
  <td class='referenceTd'><p>By default, this property is unchecked. When selected, this property works when form layouts have either a width or height set at 100%. When you resize the browser window, the layouts in the current form are  redrawn so that  it fits the current window's size. </p>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: For complex layouts, it is not recommended that you use this property, as the entire page is redrawn. As a result, redrawing the entire page may take a while. Depending on the complexity of the page  and the slowness of your computer, you may see a delay in seeing the page being redrawn.</p></td>

<tr>
  <th class='referenceTh'>Show Resize Bar</th>
  <td class='referenceTd'>Optional</td>
  <td class='referenceTd'>This feature only works when the Vertical Layout is parented by a Horizontal Layout or another Vertical Layout. If true, a resize bar is created for Vertical Layout, that allows the user to resize the Vertical Layout by dragging it, and show/hide layout by clicking it. The orientation of the Resize bar depends on the parent - Vertical Layout parent yields a resize bar left-and-right, Horizontal Layout yields a resize bar up-and-down. The length of the resize bar is also dictated by the parent. Specifically it is the height of the Vertical Layout parent, or the width of the Horizontal Layout parent, that determines the resize bar's length; an explicit width/height value must be set to have the resize bar appear. Default is <i>default</i>, which is not showing the Resize Bar.</td>

<th class='referenceTh'>Style</th>
<td class='referenceTd'>Optional</td>
<td class='referenceTd'>Choose from styles within the selected stylesheet (located in the Velocity Studio toolbar), which defines the styling of the Vertical Layout such as positioning and colour. Default is NONE.</td>

<tr>
  <th class='referenceTh'>Tooltip</th>
  <td class='referenceTd'>Optional</td>
  <td class='referenceTd'>Defines the tooltip text that is displayed in a hover box when the cursor hovers over the Vertical Layout. Default is empty, which means that a tooltip has not been defined.  During runtime, the tooltip may be difficult to find as it is not the only layout on the screen and may cover a large area.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
  <th class='referenceTh'>Visible</th>
  <td class='referenceTd'>Optional</td>
  <td class='referenceTd'>Defines the user permissions assigned to this layout. Pre-defined system <a href="../Metadata_Objects/Permission/Permissions Velocity.html">Permissions</a> such as addPerm, deletePerm, editablePerm, attachPerm, executePerm, and visiblePerm can be assigned as well as Object Permissions.  Defaults to NONE, which means no permissions assigned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th class='referenceTh'>Width</th>
<td class='referenceTd'>Optional</td>
<td class='referenceTd'>Width used or consumed by the Vertical Layout. The value is defined as the number of pixels (integer) or as a percentage of page width or of the parent element. For example, 30% of the page width or 150 pixels.</td>

*If this element is the first element that appears in the Element Tree pane, you can set the cell alignment. If this element has a parent layout, for example vlayout or hlayout with the width/height set, this element uses these values as a base to set its alignment. If the parent layout does not contain a width/height, then this element does not have a base to which it can set its alignment.   If the element has a parent that contains width/height settings, but this form is displayed under another layout with different widths, your form alignment is restricted to the parent's width/height settings. 
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If you require drawing a border or box around a label or single form item element, wrap the element with Grid Layout instead of Horizontal Layout, Vertical Layout, Horizontal Stack Layout, or Vertical Stack Layout. The following are examples of drawing a border around a label:
    <ul>
      <li>It is recommended that you use a Grid Layout with the <strong>Edge</strong> property selected and a Label element under the layout: <br>
        <br>
        <img src="Edged grid layout.png" alt="Edged grid layout" border="1"> <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>It is not recommended that you use a Vertical Layout with the <strong>Edge</strong> property selected and a Label element under the layout:<br>
        <br>
        <img src="Edged vertical layout.png" alt="Edged vertical layout" border="1"><br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The reason for using the Grid Layout is that at runtime, the label and any form element that is not under Grid Layout) is already wrapped with Grid Layout.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By default, vertical layouts have a height of 1 px. If your dynamic forms, such as ones displayed through a form frame, are not appearing runtime, ensure that there is a height specified on at least the parent layout of  that form frame, or on the form frame itself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can <a href="Element - Horizontal Layout.htm#showBrowserScrollBar">display your Web browser's scroll bar</a> when your browser's window is too slow to view the entire application page. These steps involve setting properties to your main layout and other child layouts.<br>
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
