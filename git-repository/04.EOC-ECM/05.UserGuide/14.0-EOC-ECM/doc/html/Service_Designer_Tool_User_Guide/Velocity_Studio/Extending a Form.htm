<h3><a name=""></a>Extend a Form</h3>

<p>You can extend any existing Form, referred to as the <i>base Form</i>, to create a new Form under the same User Interface. The new Form contains all the Form Elements of the base Form; you can then add, replace or delete Form Elements to further customize from the base Form.</p>

<p>One of the common uses of the Extend function is to extend from a base Form that is inherited from a base metadata object (that is, a Document is extended from a base Document). This way, you only need to add on Form Elements of additional variables of the extended metadata object, rather than building the Form from scratch.</p>

<p>To extend a Form, do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <b>Metadata tab</b> of <b>Navigation</b> pane, right-click the base Form you wish to extend. The User Interface of the base Form can be a top-level User Interface or an included User Interface. Select <b>Extend</b><strong>.</strong><br>
  <br>
</li>

<br>
<li>The new extended Form has the Name of the base Form with appended "Ex"; the icon of the extended Form has a red flower at the top-right corner. The Form is added under the same User Interface of the base Form.<br>
  <br>
</li>
<img src="extendForm2.png" align="absmiddle" border="1" alt="Extended form with icon indicating that is is extended, along with an appended Ex in the extended form's name" />
    
</ul>

<p>The extended Form has all the Form Elements of base Form, with "lock" at the top-left corner of their icons to show that they are from the base Form.</p>

<p>At the Element Tree Pane, you can:
<ul>
<li><b>Add</b> a Form Element to the Form, in the same way as in a regular Form. The added Form Element does not have the lock shown in its icon.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> a base Form Element. The deleted Form Element still appears in the Element Tree Pane, with a red cross at the top-left of the icon. However, it is not rendered at Preview pane or when at runtime. You can <i>undelete</i> it by right-click it and select <b>Delete</b>.</li>
<li><b>Replace</b> a base Form Element with another Form Element. The new Form Element appears in the Element Tree Pane with a green arrow at the top-left of the icon. You can revert the replacement by right-click it and select <b>Delete.</b></li>
<li><strong>Copy and Replace</strong> a Form (which is the equivalent to editing a base Form element).</li>
<li><strong>Copy a Form</strong> allows you to copy and then edit an exiting Form.</li>
<li><strong>Paste a Form</strong> allows you to move an exiting Form to a new location.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, there is drag and drop functionality which allows you to reorder Forms that appear in the Form Element Tree provided that they are not locked.</p>
<p>The following are Element Tree pane samples of each action performed to the base Form.</p>
