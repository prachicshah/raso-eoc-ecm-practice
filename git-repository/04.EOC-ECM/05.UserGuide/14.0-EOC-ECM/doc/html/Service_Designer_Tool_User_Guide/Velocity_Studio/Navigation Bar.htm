<h1>Navigation Bar </h1>
<p>The Navigation Bar is one of the  metadata objects available under the top-level Presentation item. It displays a series of steps contained within an procedure. Each step  (such as an order) is configured as a Navigation Bar Item and is represented as a clickable image.  When a user clicks an image, the related data  for that step displays in a Form Frame that appears beneath (or when using a vertical setup to the right) of the Navigation Bar image. </p>

<p>The Navigation Bar   acts as a progress bar displaying information about each step in a procedure. Each step, represented by a Navigation Bar object, uses a graphic image to  display the state of the step. As the end user navigates through the steps of a procedure, the graphic images provides a visual queue indicating the current step, steps that have been completed and those that are outstanding. </p>
<p>The Navigation Bar is configured by extending the system User Interface object. This object uses the same patterning as MVC and includes some predefined variables, methods and metadata to enable the Navigation Bar's functionality.</p>
<p>See <a href="Creating_Navigation Bar.htm">Creating a Navigation Bar Object</a> for more information about Navigation Bar configuration.</p>
