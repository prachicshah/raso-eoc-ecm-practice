<h3><a name=""></a>Override a Form</h3>

<p>You can override a base Form that is inherited in the User Interface when extending from a base metadata object. These Forms are shown with a lock mini-icon at the top-left of the Form icon <img src="baseFormIcon.png" align="absmiddle" border="0" alt="Extend a form - Form icon with lock" />. The base Form is removed from the User Interface, and is replaced by a blank Form in the same name.</p>

<p>One of the common uses of the Override function is to implement <b>Default</b> Forms (that is, Forms named "Default") that are inherited from system-base metadata objects, some of them exist as a placeholder and intended to be overridden.</p>

<p>To override a Form, do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <b>Metadata tab</b> of <b>Navigation</b> pane, right-click the base Form that you want  to extend. The User Interface of the base Form can be a top-level User Interface or an included User Interface. Select <b>Override</b><strong>.</strong><br>
  <br>
</li>

<img src="overrideForm.png" align="absmiddle" border="1" alt="Override a form" />
    
<li>The overriding Form has the same Name of the base Form; the icon of the overriding Form has a green arrow at the top-left corner. The Form is created under the same User Interface of the base Form.<br>
  <br>
</li>

<img src="overrideForm2.png" align="absmiddle" border="1" alt="Overridiing the default form - green arrow on form icon" />
    
<br>
</ul>

<p>The overriding Form is created as a blank Form with no Form Elements.</p>
