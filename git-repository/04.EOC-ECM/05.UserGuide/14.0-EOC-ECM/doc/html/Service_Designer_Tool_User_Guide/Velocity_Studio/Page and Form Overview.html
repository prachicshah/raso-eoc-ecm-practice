<h2>Page and Form Comparison</h2>
<p> Although there are similarities between Page and Form objects, there are fundamental differences in functionality; specifically which Form elements that they display and how they them. From a metadata perspective, a Page is similar to a Form, but a Form has more functionality than a Page. Understanding how to configure and use these objects is a key component to  configuring metadata objects in a User Interface.</p>
<h3>User Interface Page</h3>
<p> A Page represents the formatting of a  Web Page and displays the presentation (physical layout) for an application at runtime. Under the User Interface object, a Page represents a top-level Form. It can appear in metadata objects that have included User Interfaces such as Documents, Finders, Orders, and Data Structures. Only  one Page exists for each User Interface object.  A Page contains settings for Style sheets, Skins, Icons and the Body Style. A Page can be configured with additional elements that format the Page at runtime.</p>
<h3>User Interface Form</h3>
<p>By default, Forms are created when a User Interface object is created. While a Page  represents the formatting  of a Web page, a Form defines the presentation of a fragment of a Web page (field, sections). It can appear in metadata objects that have included User Interface objects, such as Documents, Finders, Orders and Data Structures.</p>

<p>The following information details the characteristics of a Page and a Form.</p>
