An application  program is a program designed to perform a specific function directly for the  user or, in some cases, for another application program.

Â For example, web browsers, e-mail programs,  word processors are all applications. The word application is used because each  program has a specific application for the use; they may have different file  extensions but serves the same purpose.
  </ul>
  <h4 name="UserInterface"><a name="UserInterface">User Interface</a></h4>
  <ul>
A user interface (UI) is the means in which you can control a software  application. UI works as a connection between a user and a computer program. An  interface is a set of commands or menus. A good user interface provides a  User-Friendly experience, allowing the user to interact with the software. An  application can have different user interfaces. But they can share many of the  same elements that results in providing a consistent user experience across  multiple programs.
