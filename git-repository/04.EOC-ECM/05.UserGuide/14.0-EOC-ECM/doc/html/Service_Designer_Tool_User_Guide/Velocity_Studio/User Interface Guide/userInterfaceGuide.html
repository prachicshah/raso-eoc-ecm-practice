<h2>User Interface User Guide</h2>
<br>
<a href="./glossaryforUI.html#UserInterface" title="What is User Interface"> User Interface</a> is a metadata object that implements the controller of the architecture pattern. There are two different types of User Interface available: 
<ul>
<li>	Included User Interface</li>
<li>	Top-level User Interface</li>
</ul><br>
User Interfaces are defined within a metadata object that may contain User Interface objects such as Documents, Orders, and Finders. With an included User Interface, the model in MVC pattern connects with the controller. Top-level User Interfaces are defined as a stand-alone metadata object, although their model is attached to the data source. Either type of User Interfaces provides data and business logic access to the View in the MVC pattern using variables and methods.
In this user guide the following topics are covered on how to customize a User Interface Application with the built in functionality of User Interfaces. <br>
