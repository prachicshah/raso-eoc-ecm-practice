<p>Certain portions of Ericsson software ("Ericsson Software") are provided under public, open source, or third-party license terms ("Ancillary Software"). Ancillary Software is licensed subject to the terms and conditions of the software license agreement(s) accompanying such Ancillary Software, whether in the form of a separate agreement, shrink wrap license, or electronic license terms provided with the Ericsson Software. Ericsson identifies any Ancillary Software by either noting the Ancillary Software provider's ownership within each Ancillary Software program file and/or by providing information in the "3rdparty.txt" or "readme" files that are provided as part of the installation of the Ericsson Software. The Ancillary Software licenses are also set forth in the "3rdparty.txt" or "readme" files. If you want to obtain a separate copy of such list and license agreements, contact <a href="mailto:cw.support.group@ericsson.com">cw.support.group@ericsson.com</a>. Use of the Ancillary Software is governed entirely by the terms and conditions of such license(s) and, with respect to Ericsson, by the limitations and disclaimers in your license agreement with Ericsson relating to Warranties, Intellectual Property Infringement Indemnification, and Limitations of Liability. Ancillary Software suppliers are intended beneficiaries under these terms and independently may protect their rights in the Ancillary Software in the event of any infringement.</p>

<p>If the Ancillary Software is licensed under the GNU General Public License and/or the GNU Lesser General Public License ("GPL Software") or under other license agreement(s) containing substantially similar terms with respect to access to source code ("Other OS Software"), a complete machine-readable copy of the GPL Software source code ("GPL Source Code") or Other OS Software source code ("Other OS Source Code"), in each case together with any modifications made by Ericsson required to be so disclosed, is either included with the Ericsson Software or upon your written request, Ericsson will provide to you, for a fee covering the cost of delivery, if any, a complete machine-readable copy of the GPL Source Code or Other OS Source Code, in each case together with any modifications made by Ericsson and a description of such modifications required to be so disclosed, by mail or by electronic delivery in the same manner as the Ericsson Software was delivered. Information about how to make a written request for GPL Source Code or other OS Source Code may be found in the "3rdparty.txt" or "readme" files, or by contacting <a href="cw.support.group@ericsson.com">cw.support.group@ericsson.com</a>.</p>

<p>To the extent necessary to comply with the terms of any Ancillary Software license, Ericsson grants the right to reverse-engineer the Ericsson Software solely for the purpose of debugging any modification you may make to the Ancillary Software to the extent permitted or required under such Ancillary Software license terms. A list of Ancillary Software in respect of which this right is granted may be found in the "3rdparty.txt" or "readme" file, or by contacting <a href="mailto:cw.support.group@ericsson.com">cw.support.group@ericsson.com</a>. You acknowledge that if you replace or modify any Ancillary Software, you will not necessarily be able to recompile the Ericsson Software to use the modifications, nor will Ericsson support the Ericsson Software to the extent modified.</p>

<p>To the extent that the terms of your license agreement with Ericsson differ from any Ancillary Software licenses, with respect to warranties, support services, or other terms, such additional terms are offered by Ericsson alone and not by any supplier of such Ancillary Software.</p>

<p>Some Ancillary Software, which is not public or open source software, is licensed under terms which may limit the use of such Ancillary Software to a runtime license of the Ancillary software as part of the Ericsson Software and prohibit licensees of the Ericsson Software from the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Modifying or creating derivative works of such Ancillary Software</li>
	<li>Removing or altering marks or proprietary notices or labels contained in the Ancillary Software</li>
	<li>Reverse-compiling, reverse-engineering, dissembling, unobfuscating, reformatting, or otherwise attempting to read or make readable any portion of the code (or the underlying ideas, algorithms structure, or organization) of the Ancillary Software</li>
	<li>Accessing or using the APIs in the Ancillary Software</li>
	<li>Renting, leasing, selling, sublicensing, granting a security interest in, or otherwise transferring any rights in the runtime license of the Ancillary Software independently of the Ericsson Software.</li>
</ul>


<p>The provisions in your license agreement with Ericsson relating to these terms are intended to protect suppliers of such Ancillary Software.</p>
