<h3>Access the User Worklist</h3>
<p>The top right corner of the user interface shows the number of tasks   (<strong>Tasks (<em>number</em>)</strong>) currently assigned to the logged-in user. It also shows whether the current user   is available for task assignment. </p>
<p><img src="tasksIcon.png" alt="Number of tasks and user task availabiility" border="1"></p>
<p>In this example, the logged-in user has one task assigned to him. The green circle indicates that this user is   available for task assignment.</p>
<p>For the (<strong>Tasks (<em>number</em>)</strong>), if the logged-in user does not have the proper privilege to work with any participant in your metadata project (that is, no tasks can be assigned to this user), the number of tasks does not appear. Clicking the <strong>Tasks (<em>number</em>)</strong> opens the User Worklist (that is, the My Tasks page).</p>
<p>Next to the <strong>Tasks (<em>number</em>)</strong> is the user worklist availability icon, which shows whether the current user is available for task assignment. By default, this icon is a green ball, indicating that the user is available. Otherwise, this icon is grey, meaning that the user is unavailable. This icon is only visible if the worklist counter is visible.</p>
<p>Users with the WSetAvailable privilege set in the User Profile Management application can click the user worklist availability icon to toggle states. A popup dialog appears, prompting you to confirm whether to change this state from available to unavailable, or vice-versa. Click the <strong>Yes</strong> button to confirm. If the user does not have this privilege, clicking this icon results in no action being performed.</p>
