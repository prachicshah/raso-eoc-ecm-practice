<h2>Introduction to Metadata Migration</h2>
<p>If you have metadata from previous product releases, you must migrate that metadata to the current release before you can continue your metadata development. This guide details the migration process.</p>

<p>Since product version 14.x, the storage of metadata is changed from  file-system to database. Thus, migration is mandatory if you have metadata from version 5.x or earlier. In a nutshell, this migration retrieves an existing metadata version in your database, converts any metadata objects that are impacted since the metadata's working release, and writes into your specified database from project root directory. This migration also includes your resources and libraries that were imported into the metadata, but excludes any configuration set for the metadata version by the Configuration application. Thus you must reconfigure after migration.</p>
<p>You can migrate the metadata through the following ways:</p>
<li><a href="Migrating from different 5.x releases.html">Migration through Velocity Studio</a></li>
<li><a href="configServicesMigration.html">Migration through Command Line</a></li>
