<h4>Searching</h4>

	<p>
	To quickly locate topics on a particular subject in the documentation, enter a
	query in the <b>Search</b> field.  The search results appear in the right pane. The search is set to match all words by default. If the search criteria contain two or more words in the <strong>Search</strong> field,  you can select <strong>any search words</strong><em>.</em> This  setting changes the default search method and provides more results. You can select <strong>all search words</strong> to narrow down the results. The number of results shown on one page can be changed from the <strong>Result per page</strong> drop-down menu.</p>
	<h5>Exact and Highlighted Search Results</h5>
	<p>If you enter<tt> edit </tt>in the <strong>Search</strong> field and click the Search<strong> </strong>button, all help pages that exactly match <strong>edit</strong> appear in right pane as search results. If you click one of the search result documents, highlighted is the word <em>edit</em> with in that document. </p>
	<h5>Specific Keywords and Wildcard Searches</h5>
	<p>You can conduct wildcard searches in the <strong>Search</strong> field by appending an asterisk (*) after your search criterion. For example, enter <tt>edit*</tt> to search for pages that contain derivatives of <strong>edit</strong>, such as editor, e<SPAN id="highlight" name="highlight">ditable</SPAN>, <SPAN id="highlight2" name="highlight">editing</SPAN>, <SPAN id="highlight3" name="highlight">edited</SPAN>, and so on. </p>
	<p> Some keywords, such as <strong>and</strong>, <strong>or</strong> and <strong>this</strong>, require that you append an asterisk after them. For example, if you are searching for a page containing <strong>this.model.isStored</strong>, enter <tt>this*</tt> to conduct your search.</p>
    <h5>Manual Search</h5>
<p> The table of contents are available for manual navigation in the left pane, if you want to search a particular topic without using the search functionality.</p>

<h3>Within Velocity Studio</h3>
<p>Once you have installed the product, the help documentation is accessible within Velocity Studio by clicking <b>Help &gt; Help Contents</b> from the menu bar. The help documentation is powered by <i>Eclipse Help system</i>, which supports documentation searching, breadcrumbs, synchronization between the table of contents and contents panes, documentation printing, and other capabilities.</p>

<!--	<h4>Bookmarking</h4>
	
	<p>
	You can bookmark the current topic within the Help system, by clicking on the Bookmark Document button (<img class="icon" src="search_results_view.gif" alt="Search icon">). The bookmarking is within Service Designer's Help system, not your browser's bookmarking, and is persistent...
	</p>-->
    

	<h5>Synchronizing</h5>
	
	<p>
	Clicking the
	<b>Show in Table of Contents</b> button <span class="icon">(<img class="icon"
	src="e_synch_toc_nav.gif" alt="Show in Table of Contents icon">)</span> will
	select that topic in the navigation tree. The 
	<b>Link with Contents</b> button <span class="icon">(<img class="icon"
	src="e_auto_synch_toc.gif" alt="Link with Contents icon">)</span> keeps 
	the navigation tree synchronized to the current topic.
	</p>

	<h5>Enabling Scripts</h5>
	<p>The Velocity Studio Help system requires running JavaScript in your browser. In the event that your browser has disabled JavaScript, a basic version of the Help system is presented, with the URL parameter <i>noscript=1</i> auto-appended.</p>	

<img src="HelpDesignerBasic.png" border="1" alt="Running help with JavaScript disabled" />

	<p>If you have subsequently allowed your browser to run scripts (for example,  in Internet Explorer, choose <i>Allow Blocked Content...</i> from the Information Bar that is displayed), you can enable the full version to run again by removing the <i>noscript=1</i> parameter from the URL.</p>
