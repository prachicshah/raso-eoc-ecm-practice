<h1>Use the Log File to Provide Dump Details</h1>
<p>You may encounter problems with process threads, process engines (PEs), and more. Often times, error dumps occur, which are captured in an error log file. The following is an example of locating a thread error and how to capture its details from the log file, which can provide the support team with valuable information to troubleshoot your problem.</p>
<ol>
  <li> In Windows Explorer, navigate to &lt;<em>product_installation_folder</em>&gt;\designer\env\log to view a list of Velocity Studio log files.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="dumpLogFilesList.png" alt="List of log files" width="583" height="287" border="1"><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Double-click the log file that you want to view. The following is a thread error in the log.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="dumpLogFile.png" alt="Log file - dump error"><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Highlight the error and details that follow it. Proceed to copy the information by pressing the <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>C</em> keys, and do one of the following actions: </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Paste (press the <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>V</em> keys) the information in your e-mail to the support team.</li>
    <li>In a text editor, such as Wordpad, open a new document, paste the information, and then save the file. You can then send your file as an attachment in your e-mail to the support team.<br>
