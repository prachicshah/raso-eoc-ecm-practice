<h2><strong>Configure M</strong>icroflows</h2>
<p>A microflow is a  fully modeled workflow within the platform. You model microflows as processes,  not as sub-flows. The primary difference is that they can instantiate themselves  (without calling a parent), and may define their own parameters, rather than  inheriting the calling parent&rsquo;s parameters. You can access the Configure Microflow option using the Quick Start menu on the Ericsson Catalog Manager home page or by clicking <strong>Configuration </strong>&gt;<strong> Configure PLD </strong>&gt;<strong> Configure Microflow </strong>to allow you to  <a href="#Search Microflow"> Search</a>, <a href="#Add Microflow">Add</a>, <a href="#Copy Microflow">Copy</a>, and <a href="#Delete Microflow">Delete</a> microflow. You can also <a href="#Convert to TAS">Convert a microflow to a Technical  Action Specification (TAS)</a> from this page.
