<h2>Validate Project</h2>
<p>The Validate Project function allows you to validate a project. This functionality detects and reports the following catalog anomalies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All catalog objects that are active, but their referenced objects are not active.</li>
  <li>For a catalog object that has two intervals (one interval defines a valid version of the object, and the other defines a valid version for objects that reference this catalog object), the first interval takes precedence. Any catalog object that  does not satisfy this condition appears in this report.</li>
  <li>All catalog objects that do not have a project.</li>
  <li>All project assignments referencing catalog objects that do not exist in the catalog.</li>
  <li>All catalog objects for which there are two or more versions with the same start date and end date. As an extension,  consider CTLG_TIME_UNIT. If the difference between the start dates of two versions is less than the catalog time unit, these versions are reported.</li>
  </ul>
<p>To use the Validate Project function, complete the following steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>From the menu bar, click <strong>Designer </strong>&gt;<strong> Projects</strong> to launch the Projects node in the left pane.</li>
  <li>Select the project that you want to validate, and then click <strong>Configuration</strong> &gt; <strong>Validate Project</strong> from the menu bar.</li>
  <li>The Response Summary dialog appears with two sections:  
    <ul>
    <li>A Summary section, which describes the total number of objects that were validated, and a breakdown of how many objects were valid and invalid</li>
    <li>An Error List section, which describes the error and which object is affected<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    
    </ul>

  <br>
  </li>
  <li>You have the option of saving the information to a file by clicking the drop-down icon on the right side of the Error List heading. Otherwise, when you have finished reviewing the report, click the <strong>Close</strong> button to close the Response Summary dialog.<br>
