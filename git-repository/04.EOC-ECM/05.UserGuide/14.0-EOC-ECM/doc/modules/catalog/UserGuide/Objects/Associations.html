<h2>Association Types</h2>
<p> Associations define all characteristics of the item (for example,  content, structure, business rules, business name, image, specification, and so on). Association Types can be created within  the Catalog to define items with any level of detail and any rule complexity.  </p>
<p>In general, an association links a Catalog object to another Catalog object or set of data items. The majority of associations are item associations.
  Some associations have a static, predefined set of properties. Other associations allow user-defined content, such as a list of attributes. The values of these attributes are defined within the Catalog  and are immutable at runtime (that is, they are association properties).</p>
<p>When you create a new item, the associations that are created are grouped by association type and are listed as a drop-down list for the <strong>Type</strong> field. For example, if you create an attachment association called <strong>Certificate upload</strong> in the <strong>Type</strong> field, you can access this association when creating the item under the Attachments folder, as follows:</p>
<img src="AttachmentAssociationExample.png" alt="Attachment Association" />

<p>You can perform the following actions with an association type:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="AssociationsSearch.html">Search for an association type</a></li>
  <li><a href="Associations_Details.html">Create an association</a></li>
  <li><a href="../Catalog_Composition/Association.html">Item associations</a></li>
</ul>
