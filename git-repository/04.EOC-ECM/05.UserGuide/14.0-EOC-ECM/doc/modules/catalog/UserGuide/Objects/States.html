<h2>Status</h2>
<p>Various elements within Catalog Designer,  such as a project, are given a <em>status</em>. The system comes with  predefined statuses -- from <strong>Definition</strong> to <strong>Active</strong> -- that provide visibility of the element's state within the product life cycle. </p>
<p>The <strong>Definition</strong> status defines the catalog element's during the design phase.  The catalog definition elements can be changed without any impact to the production environment. During this phase, elements can continue to be added, changed, or deleted, and there is no impact on the production catalog definition.</p>
<p>The <strong>Development</strong>, <strong>Conception</strong>, <strong>Evaluation</strong>, <strong>Testing</strong>, and <strong>Launch Product</strong> statuses are available in the design phase. These statuses are for information purposes only.  Like in the <strong>Definition</strong> status, project objects can be changed, deleted, or added  without any impact on the production catalog definition. </p>
<p> Elements in <strong>Active</strong> status are used in production, and cannot be changed or deleted directly in the production environment. Once an element has become active, its field elements are immutable (that is, they cannot be changed). As a result, neither the start or end dates can be changed. To change an <strong>Active </strong>element, assign the element to a project, and then you can make changes in <strong>Definition</strong> status.</p>
