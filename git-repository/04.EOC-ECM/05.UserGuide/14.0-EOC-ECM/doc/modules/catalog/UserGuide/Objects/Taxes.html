<h3>Details</h3>
<p>The Tax Detail page appears by Clicking the Add button on the Taxes Search page and it displays the details of the Tax Code.  The Tax Code defines the percentage of Tax to be applied, and the start and end dates for which this tax is applied. When a Tax record is created a version is also created for the Tax. The following figure shows the Tax Detail as well as the Version detail.</p>

<h3>Versions / Copy</h3>
<p>By performing a <strong>Copy</strong> of a Tax Code, the system creates a version of that Tax Code.  This version is a clone of the copied instance and maintains the associations to all other objects.   When a new version is created, the Start Date field is required but the End Date field can remain empty.  A blank End Date means that the life span of the version is unlimited into the future.

  It is possible to have various version of the Tax Code that are Active at the same time and have overlapping Start and End Dates.  The system will select the version whose start date most closely matches the application request date.  The system will sort the versions by Start Date in descending order and will use the first version that is alive (for example, the version is within the start date and end date window).
  </p>
<p>For example, if there were two versions: </p>
<ol type="A">
<li> Start Date = December 23, 2010   and End Date = <i>blank </i></li>
<li> Start Date = December 30, 2010   and End Date = <i> blank</i></li>
<li> Start Date = January 16, 2011 and End Date = February 1, 2011</li>
</ol>
If the application request time, was December 24, then Version A would be selected.  However, if the application request time were December 31, 2010, then Version B would be selected.  An application request date of January 30, 2011 would select Version C but  a request date of February 2, 2011 would select Version B.
