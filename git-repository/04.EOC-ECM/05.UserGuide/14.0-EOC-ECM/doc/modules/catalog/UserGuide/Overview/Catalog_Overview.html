<h2>Catalog Designer</h2>
<p>The Catalog Designer allows you to define products and services (referred to as <em>Products</em>), their logical and physical components,  eligibility and availability rules, pricing, and any offers on these products. The key differentiating factor is the ability to drive not only order entry, but also  fulfillment activities, from the catalog. </p>
