<h2>Benefits of Using Catalog Designer</h2>

<p>There are many benefits of using Catalog Designer:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p><strong>Faster Time to Market</strong><br>
	Tight integration with the Integrated Telecom's Order Entry and Order Management systems creates a catalog environment in which new products can be quickly added or changed with minimal IT expertise, resulting in reduced development costs and faster time to market.</p>

<p><strong>Resource-Based View</strong><br>
Each product within the catalog consists of a set of resources that are required to fulfill the product. Resources or Components may reflect a  physical resource such as a set-top box, or a logical resource such as an SVC.</p>

<p><strong>Defining Eligibility</strong><br>
The Catalog provides a one-stop solution for defining both the general market availability of each product (for example, by market segment or geographic location) and the product's specific eligibility rule, such as a subscription to another product. </p>

<p><strong>Linking Product Components and Workflow</strong><br>
Traditionally, driving a product's fulfillment consists of defining a set of product workflows and selecting  the appropriate workflows to instantiate based on the product, the market, rollout date, availability of underlying resources, supplier selection, and more. These two components have been traditionally hardwired into the logic of order management systems, resulting in a complex, costly mess after several years of operation and change. A catalog-driven fulfillment approach relies on the power of a catalog to perform these functions, including provisioning a product for a target market, with a specific due date and supplier. </p>

<p><strong>Telecom Context</strong><br>
The main restriction  in all catalogs is the rules engine's ability to implement business rules. In the telecommunications domain, the key constraint is the   rules engine's ability to access and interpret the context in which these rules must be evaluated. In other words, the  complexity of the order and services, and the underlying commercial customer hierarchies are beyond that of most catalogs to implement. The Catalog Designer is purposely built for such an environment and has taken these complexities into consideration when   designing the catalog as a whole and its rules engine.</p>

	<p><strong>Support for External Catalogs and Systems</strong><br>
	  Catalog data is spread throughout most organizations, and  budgets and legacy technology may preclude the wholesale migration of this data into a central catalog. Instead of synchronizing this data, catalog<sup></sup> offers the ability to supplement its own information with that contained within external catalogs. This data may be accessed in real-time through  Web services or JDBC access, or through the information model where data is periodically pushed in native format.</p>
