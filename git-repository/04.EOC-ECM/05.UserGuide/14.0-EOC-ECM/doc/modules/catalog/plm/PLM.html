<h2>Product Lifecycle Designer</h2>
<p>The Product Lifecycle Designer (PLD) feature provides a process to enable change requests for catalog items to be processed into the live production environment.  The PLD workflow process contains six stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>conception</li>
<li>evaluation</li>
<li>definition</li>
<li>build</li>
<li>testing</li>
<li>launch product</li>
</ul> 
<p>The change request workflow process can be configured to enable specific PLD processes, as well as define specific users to approve the various stages of the change request. The PLD workflow process sends out tasks to groups of users defined in each workflow stage.   Once all the tasks have been completed in each stage, an approval task is sent to the users defined in the project change request for that stage. </p>
<p>The product manager can configure both the product lifecycle development  and the approval processes.  The product manager can also configure which stages of the PLD workflow process to be implemented. The PLD can be as complex as having all six stages or as simple as using just one of the stages. The product manager can determine which specific user can approve the changes from various departments and specify a deadline for approval.  Once all approvals have been completed, the change request is approved and the project can be launched or made <em>active</em>. An <i>active</i> project implies that all changes are available to the production environment.</p>
<p>The PLD feature uses Velocity Studio's Process Engine to manage the change request process through a workflow.  <strong>Approval</strong> or <strong>create</strong> tasks are assigned to users to <em>approve</em> the change request, or to <em>start</em> and <em>complete</em> the tasks. There are various stages in the Product Lifecycle Designer, each of which contain their own workflow and tasks. </p>
